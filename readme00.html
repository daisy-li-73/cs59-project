                **Project 00 **

The Domain
=================
The domain of this project is scoring and evaluation of student code. 

The Problem
================
We would like to create an autograder for code submissions similar to what you would
find in a beginnign coding class. The autograder will take in file names as input,
read the code in the files, and evaluate the code based on certain predefined criteria. 
For instance, the autograder might evaluate the code's efficiency based on number of lines,
number of loops, number of variables, etc. The autograder can also evaluate style by checking 
for the presence and quality of header comments. We would also like to implement a plagiarism
checker wherein the autograder takes in two files and checks for the number of variables with the 
same name. We understand that this is a simplification of how code is evaluated in the real world,
but it should be effective for simple, beginner-level programs that don't take many lines of code to complete. 
This autograder should aid in the scoring of student code and make the process more efficient for the instructor and TAs.

Example Solutions
================
The user will submit a rubric that will be used to evaluate the code. The rubric may contain the following information:
<div class=" firstcol.noheader">
                                |      
  ------------------------------|-------------
  class                         | cs59
  due date                      | 10/10/2024
  late_penalty                  | .1
  early_time                    | 24h
  early_reward                  | .01
  functions                     | {is_even(), is_odd(), is_prime()}
  test_cases                    | test_cases.txt 
  points                        | {is_even(): 10, is_odd(): 10, is_prime(): 10}
  test_order                    | random 
  plagiarism_threshold          | .5 

  </div>

Functionality
================
<!-- Note: wrapping table in div.noheader will hide the table's header -->
<!-- Note: wrapping table in div.firstcol will style the first column different from other columns -->
<div class=" firstcol">
    Function                    |   Description   
  ------------------------------|-------------
  grader.configure()            | Sets various critera for grading. (see above code blocks for specs)
  grader.configure_func()       | Sets test cases and point distributions. 
  grader.addSubmission()        | Adds a submission (w/ metadata) to a class.
  grader.test()                 | Tests a submission against the test cases. Can randomly select test cases, or can input a graph to determine order in which to run test cases. Eg. if case 4 fails, run case 2.
  grader.grade()                | Calculates submission grade based on test results and configuration.
  grader.classGrades()          | Calculates class statistics and prints to output file. Can also include curve. 
  grader.plagiarism()           | Given a class, compares every pair of submissions and determines what percentage of variables have the same name. 
  grader.checkHeader()          | Given a submission, checks for the presence and quality of header comments 

  </div>


The autograder will take in the rubric with associated files. According to the rubric specifications,
it will run various functions as defined above. It will then print the output to a file.
