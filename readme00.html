The Domain
=================
The domain of this project is scoring and evaluation of student code. 

The Problem
================
We would like to create an autograder for code submissions similar to what you would
find in a beginnign coding class. The autograder will take in file names as input,
read the code in the files, and evaluate the code based on certain predefined criteria. 
For instance, the autograder might evaluate the code's efficiency based on number of lines,
number of loops, number of variables, etc. The autograder can also evaluate style by checking 
for the presence and quality of header comments. We would also like to implement a plagiarism
checker wherein the autograder takes in two files and checks for the number of variables with the 
same name. We understand that this is a simplification of how code is evaluated in the real world,
but it should be effective for simple, beginner-level programs that don't take many lines of code to complete. 
This autograder should aid in the scoring of student code and make the process more efficient for the instructor and TAs.

Example Solutions
================

<!-- Note: wrapping table in div.noheader will hide the table's header -->
<!-- Note: wrapping table in div.firstcol will style the first column different from other columns -->
<div class=" firstcol">
  Input                       |   Output   
------------------------------|-------------
submission.py; maxLoops=4     | Solution is inefficient. Too many loops.
submission.py; maxLines=25    | Solution is inefficient. Too many lines.
